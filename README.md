Multiband Reverb Max4Live Device

In over my head?? Maybe, but I wanted to bring this idea to life the best way I could. 

This is a free multiband reverb Max4Live device created in MaxMSP. This device consists of 4 bands across the audio spectrum “low, low-mid, high-mid, and high.” Which allows each band to possess its own reverb bank (hall, plate, room) as well as its own decay and mix knob. I made this device while studying at Berklee and the early stages of this device was horrific needless to say it is a major improvement from the beta version. It's been over a year since I worked on this but I am definitely open to suggestions, modifications, new reverb algorithms and any support/resources in order to get this over to AU, VST3 and AAX format. 

Enjoy!
